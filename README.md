# config

> Dotfiles and environment shell scripts

-----

## Usage

To install the configuration files:

```sh
./install.sh [OPTION]
```

OPTIONS:

+ `-s`, `--simple`: simple installation, ignore fancy plugins for neovim or tmux
+ `-c`, `--copy`: to copy and replace automatically your configurations files with those in the repository

A backup of your replaced configuration files is created in `/tmp/greg-config`.
